The first part of this homework explores network dynamics and learning by simulating the Influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic in Sweden. Divided into four parts, it involves simulating a pandemic on known and random graphs, estimating parameters, and comparing simulated and real pandemic data.

The second one explores distributed learning in graph coloring, progressing from a line graph to wi-fi channel assignment for routers.
